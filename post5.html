  <h1>How to Use BrowserStack to Check Device Compatibility</h1>

  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <a href="https://www.browserstack.com" target="_blank">BrowserStack</a> and create a free or paid account.</p>

  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Log in and select the type of testing you want: <em>Live</em> (real-time interactive testing) or <em>Automate</em> (automated testing).</p>

  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose the operating system, device, and browser combination you want to test your website on.</p>

  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Enter your website URL and start testing. BrowserStack will load your site on a real device/browser combination so you can check layout, responsiveness, and functionality.</p>

  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Interact with your website as if you were using the actual device. Test navigation, forms, buttons, media, and any animations.</p>

  <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Take screenshots or record sessions for reference or bug reporting.</p>
